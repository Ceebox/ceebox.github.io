        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            As a programmer, writing a blog that will probably be a lot about programming, it helps to be able to show
            code in my blog. I want to show my code nicely though, I don't want to have to copy and paste images onto
            the site, because that wouldn't look good.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thankfully, I don't have to, because I can <span class="rainbow">colour </span> my text in all sorts of
            lovely manners, thanks to the magic of the web (or CSS).
            <br>
            I can even add all sorts of conditional highlighting and <b>formatting</b> around my page.
            This means that I can achieve pretty nice-looking syntax highlighting on my page using CSS, instead of
            having to take images of my code and upload them to the website.
            <br>
            <br>
            The thing is, it is going to be time-consuming to manually colour and assign properties to all of
            the code that I upload to this site. This means that I need a way to generate it automatically. There are
            probably sites or programs that already do this for me, but that is no fun - I want to do it myself.
            Visual Studio Code does generate HTML formatted code when you copy and paste code from inside of
            it, but it is just a load of coloured <code>&lt;span></code> properties, which I don't want as it
            makes my site quite unmaintainable in case I want to give it a fresh new look. The solution to this is using
            CSS classes to properly assign the correct highlighting to certain parts of the text.
            <br>
            <br>
            If I'm doing
            that, I might as well also make the tool web-based, and host it on this site.
        </p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Thankfully, there is a solution. <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" class="rainbow">HighlightJS</a> is a
            JavaScript library that easily highlights code in a variety of different languages, outputting it in nice
            HTML using CSS classes, meaning you can add custom theming with ease.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a little bit of testing, I was happy with the results of the library. It isn't perfect, but it is
            certainly better than highlighting all of the code myself.
        </p>
        <pre><code><span class="comment">/* Here is an example, and also some code I use: */</span>
<span class="selector-tag">code</span> <span class="selector-class">.symbol</span><span class="selector-pseudo">::selection</span> {
    <span class="attribute">background-color</span>: <span class="number">#4ee2fc</span>;
}</code></pre>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            Now I had determined that <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" class="rainbow">HighlightJS</a> would be good
            enough for my needs (much to my relief, as I didn't want to write my own version), I needed to implement it
            on my website. Before I did that, I needed to create a basic template, so I created a document with a
            specially formatted text box. It was here that I discovered the magic of <code>contenteditable</code>, which
            is an HTML attribute that allows the user to edit the text contents of a <code>&lt;div></code> tag. This was
            very helpful for me, as I did not want to use a <code>&lt;textbox></code>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I initially tried to highlight the code inside of the <code>&lt;div></code> as the user typed, but that did
            not work very well as it kept resetting the user's cursor position, and moving the cursor back to where it
            was is slightly more complicated than it initially seems. Instead of coming with to a solution to that
            issue, I decided to move on and instead just add another <code>&lt;div></code> to display the output.
            <br>
            <br>
            To format the code, I had to perform a small bit of processing on it, starting with setting the
            <code>code-output language-</code> class to be the language that the user had configured, then removing the
            <code>data-highlighted</code> attribute to force HighlightJS to re-highlight the code. I then ran
            this every time the code input box's text changed.
        </p>
        <pre><code><span class="keyword">const</span> output = <span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span
    class="title function_">getElementsByClassName</span>(<span class="string">"code-output"</span>)[<span
    class="number">0</span>];
output.<span class="property">className</span> = <span class="string">"code-output language-"</span> + <span
    class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">language</span>;

output.<span class="title function_">removeAttribute</span>(<span class="string">"data-highlighted"</span>);
output.<span class="property">textContent</span> = <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span
    class="title function_">createText</span>();

hljs.<span class="title function_">highlightElement</span>(output, { <span class="attr">language</span>: <span
    class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">language</span> });

<span class="comment">// Remove hljs- class (unlucky if you have hljs- in your stuff)</span>
output.<span class="property">innerHTML</span> = output.<span class="property">innerHTML</span>.<span
    class="title function_">replaceAll</span>(<span class="string">"hljs-"</span>, <span class="string">""</span>);</code></pre>
        <p>
            At this point, I ran into a problem - my whitespace was not being preserved in the output of my code, which
            was
            almost as inconvenient as having to manually colour my code. This turned out to be quite a hard
            issue to fix, which is why I didn't. I found a very convenient <a
                href="https://medium.com/@albertogasparin/getting-plain-text-from-user-input-on-a-contenteditable-element-b711aba2cb36">article</a>
            by <a href="https://medium.com/@albertogasparin">Alberto Gasparin</a> on how to get the plain text from a
            <code>contenteditable</code> element, which might have been a bit of a cheap way out, but it did save me a
            lot of time.
            <br>
            <br>
            This was great, and it produced highlighted code, but the issue was that it only worked on one programming
            language at that point in time, Ada, the first programming language in my alphabetically ordered
            select box.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, I created a function that triggered whenever the dropdown box changed, passing in the name of the
            language selected inside of the dropdown box.
        </p>
        <pre><code><span class="keyword">if</span> (!<span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">addedScripts</span>.<span class="title function_">includes</span>(<span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">language</span>)) {
    <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">addedScripts</span>.<span class="title function_">push</span>(<span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">language</span>);
    <span class="keyword">const</span> script = <span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="title function_">createElement</span>(<span class="string">"script"</span>);

    script.<span class="property">src</span> = <span class="property">HLJS_LINK</span> + <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">language</span> + <span class="string">".min.js"</span>

    <span class="keyword">let</span> self = <span class="variable language_">this</span>;
    script.<span class="title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span class="string">"onload"</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params"></span>) {
        self.<span class="title function_">highlight</span>();
    });

    <span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="property">head</span>.<span class="title function_">appendChild</span>(script);
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            When importing the core of HighlightJS, it does not import the all of language packs required, so I need to
            import
            them, but instead of importing them when I first load the website, which would slow loading down, I import
            them afterwards dynamically, whenever the user needs them by adding the script tag to the page, then
            re-highlighting the page once it has loaded.
            <br>
            <br>
            When developing this blog, I use a Visual Studio Code extension called <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a>, which
            refreshes my page as I develop it and add new code. This is very handy, but it was quite annoying to have my
            dropdown box reset as I was making changes, I wanted it to save between reloads. To solve that, I added some
            code to read the current language from the search parameters using the <code>URLSearchParams</code> class.
        </p>
        <pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> language = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="title class_">URLSearchParams</span>(<span class="variable language_">window</span>.<span class="property">location</span>.<span class="property">search</span>).<span class="title function_">get</span>(<span class="string">"language"</span>) ?? <span class="string">"ada"</span>;

<span class="keyword">let</span> valid = <span class="literal">false</span>;
<span class="keyword">let</span> dropdown = <span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="title function_">getElementsByClassName</span>(<span class="string">"languages"</span>)[<span class="number">0</span>];
<span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">let</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; dropdown.<span class="property">length</span>; ++i) {
    <span class="keyword">if</span> (dropdown.<span class="property">options</span>[i].<span class="property">value</span>.<span class="title function_">toLowerCase</span>() === language.<span class="title function_">toLowerCase</span>()){
        valid = <span class="literal">true</span>;
        <span class="keyword">break</span>;
    }
}

<span class="keyword">if</span> (valid === <span class="literal">false</span>) {
    <span class="comment">// Just set it to the default</span>
    language = <span class="string">"ada"</span>;
}

dropdown.<span class="property">value</span> = language.<span class="title function_">toLowerCase</span>()</code></pre>
        <p>
            This code checks the <code>URLSearchParams</code> to see if they contain a <i>language</i> parameter. It
            then checks if that language exists inside the dropdown box's options, before setting the dropdown value
            (and triggering the language loading
            code that gets activated by that event).
            <br>
            <br>
            I also wanted to write this language parameter to the search bar, so I didn't have to manually input it and
            could just use the dropdown. This was very easy, using the same <code>URLSearchParams</code> class.
        </p>
        <pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> url = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="title function_">URL</span>(<span class="variable language_">window</span>.<span class="property">location</span>.<span class="property">href</span>);
url.<span class="property">searchParams</span>.<span class="title function_">set</span>(<span class="string">"language"</span>, <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">language</span>);        
history.<span class="title function_">pushState</span>({}, <span class="string">''</span>, url.<span class="property">href</span>);</code></pre>
        <p>
            After this, I wanted the user to be able to copy the output HTML to their clipboard, instead of having to
            open the developer tools to copy it. To do that, I created a button and created a function using
            <code>ClipboardItem</code> to copy the HTML to their clipboard.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've been using the tool I made to do this to create this whole article, and it has made the experience much
            better.
