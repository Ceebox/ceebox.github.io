        <h2>What is going on here?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm making a website. This is mainly to help improve my web development skills, and they've certainly come a
            long way in the few hours it has taken me to set this site up already!
            <br>
            <br>
            I aim to try and write this website using vanilla JavaScript and HTML, the old-fashioned way. This is
            because I normally don't write stuff this way (in fact, I normally don't even use JavaScript, I use
            TypeScript!).
        </p>
        <h2>Making the website</h2>
        <p>
            Setting up this website was mostly smooth sailing, but I did run into a few snags during the initial
            development.
            <br>
            <br>
            For instance, when I was creating that lovely little navigation bar that you can see at the top of this site
            (hopefully), I ran into an issue, which as a developer who doesn't do web things much at all is quite
            interesting, but any web developer will already know the solution.
            <br>
            <br>
            Instead of adding the navigation bar straight into my HTML, I decided to add a little script to insert it,
            meaning I can modify it more easily later, if I must. However, I was trying to add the navigation bar to the
            document using <code><span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span>.<span
                class="title function_">insertAdjacentElement</span>()</code>, but I was getting errors saying that
            <code><span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span></code> was
            undefined - how strange!
            <br>
            <br>
            The issue actually turned out to be that the code was being loaded and executed before the document had
            properly been initialised.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are a few solutions to this, such as putting your
            <code><span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span></code> tag after
            everything in your document body, but I didn't like this, so I decided
            to
            go for the more programmy approach and defer the creation of the navigation bar until after the document
            fired an event saying that it was loaded.
        </p>
        <pre><code><span class="variable language_">window</span>.<span class="title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span
class="string">"load"</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params"></span>) {
    <span class="title function_">createNavbar</span>();
});
</code></pre>
        <p>
            While setting up this website, I was dreading writing the CSS to style it, but it wasn't too bad. I even got
            dark and light theme support. I did have one big CSS issue though. You might have seen these fun <span
                class="rainbow">rainbow</span> elements scattered around the site. They were actually really easy and
            fun to implement - web developers don't know how lucky you have it with CSS animations!
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the problem came when I wanted to add a border to the video on the home page with a similar effect
            in light mode.
            It is not possible to animate a border property with a gradient in CSS (yet?), so I had to get a bit hacky
            with it.
            <br>
            <br>
            That border is actually two elements, which does something cursed with padding to try and crop it
            into looking correct, and if you don't look closely, it works pretty well.
        </p>
        <h2>The future</h2>
        <p>
            I can't anticipate that this website is going to see a lot of use, but there might be a few blog entries
            every now and then giving some insight into some of the things I'm getting up to.
            <br>
            <br>
            Have a good day!
